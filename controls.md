# controls

How do you use this? by typing code into the Example.py.

## example.py
Example.py is the place where you control it.

player = Roguelike.System(0)

The number in there, which is a 0 here, is what controls how the dungeon looks like.
If you get bored of this one, or it's too difficult, just change it to another WHOLE NUMBER, so no 3.14.
